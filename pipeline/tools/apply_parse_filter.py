"""Apply the spurious-parse filter to already-built analyses.json artifacts.

Stage 7 now filters parses at emit time (see reader_pipeline.parse_filter),
but the committed build/dist/<WORK>/analyses.json files were generated before
that. Regenerating them needs the ~115 MB Diogenes Morpheus source, which only
lives on the build machine. This script applies the identical filter directly to
the existing artifacts so the fix ships without a full pipeline rerun.

Idempotent: re-running drops nothing further. Run from the repo root:

    python pipeline/tools/apply_parse_filter.py            # all works
    python pipeline/tools/apply_parse_filter.py EN Pol     # specific works
    python pipeline/tools/apply_parse_filter.py --dry-run  # report only
