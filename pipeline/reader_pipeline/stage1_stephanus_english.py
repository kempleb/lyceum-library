"""Stage 1 English walker for Perseus' Stephanus-milestoned Plato TEI.

The Greek spine owns the section inventory. This module groups the English
prose at the TEI's ``section`` milestones, using the same ``{book}:{page}{letter}``
identifiers as that spine, AND lifts the dialogue's speaker turns out of the
prose so the reader can pair each speaker's Greek with the same speaker's
English.

Turn model (paired against the Greek spine in stage 7 via ``turns.py``)
----------
Every English TEI marks a speech as ``<said who="#Name">`` and (at print-worthy
turns) carries a ``<label>`` child with the lead-in as printed ("Socrates.",
"Soc.", "EU."). We STRIP the label from the prose — exactly as the Greek spine
strips its inline sigla — and record, per chunk, ``turns: [{offset, speaker,
display}]`` where ``offset`` is the char position in the flattened prose at which
the turn's TEXT begins, ``speaker`` is the canonical name (@who, alias-normalized,
``who="-"``/unattributed → null), and ``display`` is the printed label (null when
the said carries none, e.g. the bare reported-speech turns that mirror the
Greek's "—" dashes).

Nested ``<said>`` (reported speech quoted inside a narrated frame, e.g.
Protagoras/Euthydemus) are emitted as turns only when the manifest asks for it
(``speakers.nested: inner``). The GREEK is the arbiter of the pairing level:
where the OCT marks the inner reported turns with bare dashes the work reconciles
at inner level, so ``inner`` lets those turns pair (via the null-wildcard rule in
stage7); where it does not (Phaedo's recounting carries no Greek events at all),
the default ``frame`` level keeps only the top-level turns and the recounted
dialogue stays section-aligned prose. Per-segment pairing is self-correcting
either way — a count/name mismatch simply emits no pairs — so the flag only tunes
how much of a narrated work pairs, never whether a pairing is correct.
