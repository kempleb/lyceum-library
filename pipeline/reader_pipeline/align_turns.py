"""Turn-level translation aligner for Stephanus dialogues.

Aligns a public-domain translation's speaker turns to a work's already-emitted
reference ``turnFlow`` (English <-> English), so the new translation inherits
Stephanus anchoring for free: every reference ``FlowTurn`` already sits at a
known Stephanus column, so a new turn matched to it renders on the same reader
row.

Dramatic dialogues parse into near-1:1 speaker turns, so a Needleman-Wunsch over
the two speaker-label sequences -- diagonal matches constrained to the SAME
canonical speaker, scored by lexical (TF-IDF) cosine, gaps for inserted/dropped
turns -- pins the mapping without embeddings. This is the English<->English
analogue of the Greek<->English turn pairing in ``turns.py``. Narrated works
(few hard turns) need the embedding aligner in ``align/`` instead -- out of
scope here.

The matched new-side text is written back onto each ``FlowTurn`` as
``alt[<trans_id>] = {"e": text}``; every reference turn gets an entry, ``e`` is
null where nothing matched (the reader renders an em-dash placeholder).

Runs as a post-stage7 step: it mutates ``build/dist/<work>/book-NN.json`` in
place (that tree is what the app reads, via the ``app/public/data`` symlink),
and writes an alignment-quality report to ``build/dist/<work>/align-<id>.json``.
