"""Chapter divisions for works with no Bekker-milestoned English TEI.

Where EN reads chapter starts from the Perseus English TEI's inline Bekker
milestones (stage1_english), works like De Anima get them from the Greek side:
the First1KGreek TEI divides the text into book/chapter <div>s, and the TLG
spine is already Bekker-lineated. We text-align each chapter div's opening words
onto the spine to recover its exact (column, line).

The match is monotonic — each chapter must begin at or after the previous one —
which both fixes opening phrases that recur earlier and pins chapters that share
a column into the right order. Verified on De Anima against canonical anchors
(II.1=412a, III.1=424b22, III.4=429a10, III.5=430a10).
