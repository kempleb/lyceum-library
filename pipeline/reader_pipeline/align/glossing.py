"""Tick-window Greek segmentation for the gloss-based aligner (spec v2 Method A).

The Bekker ticks the reader shows are line 1 + every 5th line of each column
(5, 10, 15, 20, …). To place those ticks in an *unmarked* translation we have
Claude Code translate the Greek at each tick — but a tick line often falls
mid-sentence and the Greek word order won't carry straight into English, so we
hand the translator a small **window**: the line above the tick, the tick line,
and the line below. Each line is translated on its own (verse mode, the way John
translates), and the tick line's own English is the fingerprint the aligner then
hunts for in the translation.

This module only *prepares* the Greek (segmentation + window task files) and
*reads back* the glosses Claude Code writes. It performs no translation itself
and calls no API — the gloss step is done by Claude Code on the Max plan.

Everything is derived from the current work's `build/stage1` artifacts; nothing
re-parses the TLG.
